Ensemble have two type technique which is known as bagging and boosting.Â 

Bagging

- Building many predictors or model

- Take random sub-sample or bootstrap of row(data)

- Average the result or take the majority vote

- Every model must loosely correlate with each other to reduce variance

Boosting

- Predictors are made sequentially

- Predictors learn from previous predictor mistake

- Very fast

- Can lead to overfitting
