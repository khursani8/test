It already 4 months since I graduated from University and started working in Vase.ai. For this past four months I have learn a lot as a FullStack Developer in this company.

September 2017

When I first join Vase, the very first task I got is optimizing the algorithm for querying interlock criteria and make sure the ratio for given criteria is correct. The program cannot achieve exact ratio number since the number of data/row not enough to get. I need to improve the result and make sure the return ratio is as nearest to request ratio. It was such a challenging task for me since the criteria not interlock in one or two dimension but n dimension which is very hard to optimize. After 3 weeks doing R&D I got to improve the return result. After my algorithm being test and verified, I have been given task to make a website persist it state even though the page have been refresh. After completing it I move on to working on Client dashboard website.
